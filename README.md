This project loads a CSV file with 100,000 sales records and stores each row into a Record object, then compares the performance between a Binary Heap and a 4-ary Heap by timing how long it takes to build each heap and then extract every element. To run this program, make sure the file named “100000 Sales Records.csv” is located in the same directory where the executable runs (for us it was  cmake-build-debug if using CLion). You can run this project using CLion, or any other C++17 compatible environment with CMake: simply build the project and run the executable. The program prints how many rows were loaded along with the build and extract times for both heaps. The goal of this project is to measure and compare speed differences between a 2-ary (binary) heap and a 4-ary heap.
